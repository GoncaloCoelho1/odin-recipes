    <h2> Preparation Method </h2>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 1</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Put a large saucepan of water on to boil</p>
            
        <ul> <li> <strong> step 2</strong> </li> </ul>
            <p> Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. </p>
            <p>Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together</p>  
                
        <ul> <li> <strong> step 3</strong> </li> </ul>
            <p> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper </p>
            <p>Set everything aside</p>  
            
        <ul> <li> <strong> step 4</strong> </li> </ul>
         
            
             <p>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti </p>
             <p> when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked) </p> 
        
        <ul> <li> <strong> step 5</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 6</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic</p>
            <p> Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 7</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp</p>
            <p> The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 8</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low</p>
            <p> When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta</p>
            <p> Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet</p>
        <ul> <li> <strong> step 9</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 10</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese</p>
            <p> Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 11</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it)</p>
            <p> You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed</p>

        <ul> <li> <strong> step 12</strong> </li> </ul>

            <p> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl</p>
            <p> Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper</p>
            <p> If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived</p>
